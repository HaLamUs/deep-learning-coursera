# deep-learning-coursera
This project contains all my assignments from Deep Learning Specialization by prof Andrew Ng
# description
 1. Neural Network and Deep Learning
 2. Improving Deep Neural Networks-Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
 3. Convolutional Neural Network
 5. Sequence Models

This includes purely python assignments not quizzes. So course 3 will not be included
